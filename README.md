# Twilio-RSVP-Service
(Using Twilio, glob, flask and ngrok) I made a service that allows you to send messages through twilio to a list of contacts store in a folder. If you add your number to numberList.csv you can text twilio and write a message, send the message, check how many people have responded and authorize others to access these features for your distribution of the app.
